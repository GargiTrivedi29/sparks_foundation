        <h2>Donation For Survival</h2>
        <p>Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity. Actions speak louder than words.The donation made by people will help directly to the flood prone area.Even your small donation can save thousands of lives.<span>“No one has ever become poor by giving.”</span>
          We supported the affected families with ready to eat food that could support a family of 5 for a week. The kit also included hygiene materials to ensure their safety during this flood.
